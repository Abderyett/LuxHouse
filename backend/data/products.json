        "description": "Light stools and bar stools with organically shaped seats made of solid wood and with a strong attention to detail. With its well-conceived shape and wonderful finish, Pebble’s seat beckons you to touch it and is testament to a proud Scandinavian tradition of top-quality craftsmanship. Pebble comes in three heights so that they can be used for both a quick cup of coffee by the kitchen table, drinks and snacks by the bar and extra seating by the dining table. The design of the Pebble stool and bar stool is inspired by pebbles found on the beach, which even after centuries of grinding by the ocean are still not quite round. In the same way, the seats on Pebble are slightly asymmetrical and organic, which releases the beauty of the wood. Choose between three heights, metal frames in several classic colours and exclusive types of wood with exquisite finish.",

Fringe is a timeless design statement, constructed to create warm, cosy lighting by means of the fringes that conceal the light source beautifully. This exclusive pendant lamp will charm any room in the home with its soft light and graceful appearance. It is the epitome of the Warm Nordic lifestyle. Perfect for an old luxury flat with stucco ceilings, but just as wonderful in a more modern setting, where the pendant will add soul and sensuousness. The Fringe pendant lamp evokes the interiors of the past, but in a simplified design with an eye for contrasts and exclusive materials. Polished brass is combined with tactile fringes, which fall elegantly in several layers from the sophisticated brass border like a flowing skirt. It is a stunning, stylish detail that helped make the Fringe lamp a design icon. The table lamp uses LED light, which has low heat generation and a long service life.",

The round shape creates a lovely sense of connectedness, encouraging conversation and togetherness when family and friends gather round the table for a meal or to enjoy a simple cup of coffee. The metal underframe lends the Affinity Table Round an elegant lightness, accentuated by the floating appearance of the table top. The natural linoleum means the table top is pleasant to the touch. That warm tactile expression is further underpinned by the fact that the upper part of the table legs is wrapped in flat cane (strong shavings from the inner pith of the rattan palm). It is an elegant natural detail that contrasts beautifully with the rigid underframe and the classic/modern character of the table and its reference to Scandinavian design tradition. Choose from several beautiful, balanced colours from the Warm Nordic universe.",

The design of the Herringbone table is inspired by the traditional tile-topped table and has been brought into the present with a focus on quality and craftsmanship. The Herringbone console table is elegant as decorative storage in the hallway or bedroom in combination with a mirror. It is as perfect for small displays of vases, magazines and boxes in your living room as it is as an extra serving table in your kitchen. Style and functionality go hand in hand as hot objects can be placed directly on the tile-topped table. The beautiful tiles are laid by hand in Denmark and together with the metal frame, they create a level surface on the console table that brings the elegance of the classic herringbone pattern into the modern home. Choose between frames and tiles in several stunning colours from the Warm Nordic universe to match any request for either a simple or more colourful look.",

The carving plays a major role in the tray’s tactile properties, while the simple, organic design accentuates the innate beauty and unique character of the wood.
